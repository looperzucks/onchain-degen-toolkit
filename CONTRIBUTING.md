# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to improve this list.

## Rules

1. **You must have used the tool.** No affiliate link dumps.
2. **One tool per PR.** Keep it reviewable.
3. **Include a short description** of what the tool does and which chain it supports.
4. **Free tier required.** If it's paid-only, it better be exceptional.

## Format

Follow the existing table format:

```markdown
| [Tool Name](https://url.com) | What it does in one line |
```

## What We Don't Want

- Anything with referral codes baked in
- Dead or abandoned projects
- Tools that require KYC to use basic features
- Duplicate entries under different names

## Process

1. Fork the repo
2. Add your tool to the correct section
3. Open a PR with a sentence about why it belongs
4. Wait for review

That's it. Keep it clean.
